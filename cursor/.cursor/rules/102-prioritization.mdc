## Supported Frameworks

### 1. RICE Scoring
- **R**each - How many users affected
- **I**mpact - Effect on each user (0.25-3x)
- **C**onfidence - Certainty percentage
- **E**ffort - Person-months required
- Formula: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

### 2. MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have** - Critical, non-negotiable
- **Should Have** - Important but not critical
- **Could Have** - Nice to have
- **Won't Have** - Explicitly excluded (this time)

### 3. ICE Scoring
- **I**mpact - Expected outcome (1-10)
- **C**onfidence - Certainty level (1-10)
- **E**ase - Implementation ease (1-10)
- Score: Impact × Confidence × Ease

### 4. Value/Effort Matrix (2x2)
- Quick Wins (High Value, Low Effort)
- Big Bets (High Value, High Effort)
- Fill-Ins (Low Value, Low Effort)
- Money Pits (Low Value, High Effort)

### 5. Kano Model
- Must-Be (Basic expectations)
- One-Dimensional (Performance)
- Attractive (Delighters)
- Indifferent
- Reverse

## Key Components

- **Scoring tables** - Sortable by score
- **2x2 matrix** - Visual quadrant placement
- **Priority badges** - Color-coded categories
- **Comparison charts** - Bar/radar visualizations
